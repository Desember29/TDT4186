We changed the key parameters and simulated different results based one these parameters.
The changes we made were either doubling ar halving the values. All the results that we simulated are found below.
During these tests, we found that two of the parameters gave more visible changes when run.
These two were average time for arrival of new processes and max time in CPU.
Average time for arrival could create long queues in memory when halved or make the CPU go idle when doubled.
Max time in CPU had smaller changes in result in this task, but it could be more important in different situations.
The changes came with how many processes were finished, but these could be changed if there were other limitations (e.g. if a process needed to finish before another).
The other key parameters did not change the result to this degree when run with our limits, but i.e. average time in I/O could become a bottleneck if it were increased even more.
That could make the CPU idle'ing while the processes waited in queue for I/O.
